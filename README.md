# pigeon
swift 4 game 
The pigeon floats in the middle of the screen with raining cats. It zaps the cats as they fall past it. Still working on the projection of the zaps. Will be working on another Game Scene where the cats float horizontally right to left past the Pigeon.

physicsBody are my favourite - if you are having issues with them watch the Flappy Bird Tutorial on Youtube. 

Goals: 
1. Get the cats not to float and stay street bound as they pass the pigeon. Please send any code my way that will help with this goal. 
2. Create actual levels and themes for each level. 
3. Animating more assets
4. Create subgames/ challenges for users
